# RNT - BLOG WEB APPLICATION

There are many social media websites where people can share there views and ask for help but many people find it hard because of discrimination and cyber bullying, for example:
* A boy may be deppresed but cannot ask for help as there are many people who start bullying instead of helping.
* People find it hard to share there views, as the may be judged on basis of caste, gender or colour.

So, Here comes our blog site where anybody can post anonymously and can share their views openly and judgement will be only based on what you write not on who you are. But the signup is still required so we can track any mischievous activity by any user.

There are many people who are not to familiar with tech or many who don't have high end phone or laptop.

So, Here comes our blog site which is very easy to use and also lightweight.
