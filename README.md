# RNT - BLOG WEB APPLICATION

There are many social media websites where people can share there views and ask for help but many people find it hard because of discrimination and cyber bullying, for example:
* A boy may be deppresed but cannot ask for help as there are many people who start bullying instead of helping.
* People find it hard to share there views, as the may be judged on basis of caste, gender or colour.
